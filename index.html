              I currently work for a small and remote recruitment. I began as a
              humble Business Support Intern who was pushed towards Sales. I
              quickly learned that I was at my happiest and when I was solving
              technical problems with the company's software. I love being
              presented with a problem, trying to fix it myself, and turning to
              my trusty friend, Google.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy reading forum posts and help documents to do cool things
              with the technology at work (recently learned how to use the MATCH
              formula on Google Sheets with some conditional formatting -
              magic!) Fast forward to 2022, I am now the Operations Coordinator
              which is code for Admin Support / Process Improvement / GDPR
              Officer / CRM Manager / Website / Fix-This Person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working in a small organisation has its benefits of course! I love
              my close knit team and have the flexibility to tinker with our CRM
              automations and processes. However, I can't see myself staying in
              a dead-end job with no career advancement or growth opportunities.
              This is one of my "Why's" for embarking on a journey into tech.

            <p>
              Why learn to code? I have a vivid memory when I was about 10 and I
              was completely hooked by this web game called Neopets. I remember
              being able to edit my profile page by changing words inside more
              than and less than brackets. I soon found "Inspect" and started
              copying bits of text from other people's profiles. Little did I
              know that this was my first encounter with HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              With no coding role models in my life, I didn't pursue this path
              and instead took up Engineering. Today, I find myself questioning
              where I want to go and for some reason my brain recalls how happy
              I was changing basic HTML on Neopets. More questions pop up - What
              would kind of role model would my younger self have needed? And
              can I be that person for young girls whose parents worked in a
              takeaway and had never gone to university?
            </p>

              alt="Follow the white rabbit is typed in a gif."
            />
            <p>
              Learning to code and embarking on this journey to tech is a big
              dream for me. My eyes light up when I speak to my friends about
              it, I feel excited to learn, and I know I can do this. Revisiting
              code has sparked something within me. Like in The Matrix, Neo
              followed his curiosity, he followed that white rabbit and that's
              what I'm doing now.
